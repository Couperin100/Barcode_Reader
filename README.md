Barcode_Reader
==============

This is a simple barcode reader programmed in wxPython using python 2.7

I wanted to try and build a simple barcode reader for Python but couldnt find any good source code so
I decided to build my own.

The main reason why this is set out in this way to to explore and learn about OOP and how a class can process data
from other classes.  It also demonstrates how to add error dialog boxes when the barcode is too long.

I will be developing little bits here and there to further enhance it but for now it follows this process:

1) Set Focus on open ready for the first scan
2) Scans Barcode
3) Takes the serial number of the barcode and appends it to the message log textctrl

How this helps someone out there!
